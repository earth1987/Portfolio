# Projects

## 1. Machine Learning

**[1.1 Book Recommendation Systems](https://github.com/earth1987/book-content-based-recommender)**

Three content-based book recommendation systems were created and benchmarked against each other. These systems were implemented using TF-IDF, word2vec, and Sentence-BERT, matching users to books based on their reading history.

**[1.2 Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/earth1987/retail-customer-segmentation)**

Clustering algorithms are used to segment a diverse customer base into smaller, homogeneous groups based on shared characteristics. The algorithms tested include k-means, k-prototypes, and hierarchical clustering.

**[1.3 Generating Data Visualizations from Natural Language Statements](https://github.com/earth1987/Generating-Data-Visualisations-from-Natural-Language-Statements)**

A pre-trained transformer-based autoregressive language model capable of generating data visualizations from natural language statements is developed. The models tested include GPT-Neo-125M, GPT-Neo-1.3B, GPT-Neo-2.7B, and GPT-J-6B.

**[1.4 Price Prediction Using Linear & Non-Linear Regression](https://github.com/earth1987/house-price-regression)**

Regression models are used to predict house prices. Both linear models (ordinary least squares, ridge & LASSO Regression) and non-linear models (k-nearest neighbors, random forest & XGBoost) are tested.

**[1.5 Stock Price Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/earth1987/time-series-stock-prices)**

An ARIMA time series model is trained to predict stock prices for Nintendo.

## 2. Machine Learning in the Cloud

**[2.1 Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/earth1987/movie-recommender-als)**

A movie recommendation system is developed using alternating least squares and implemented in Apache Spark via PySpark. Google Cloud Dataproc is used to deploy a Spark cluster during model training.

**[2.2 Topic Modelling for Survey Feedback](https://github.com/earth1987/feedback-topic-modelling)**

Topic modelling on text feedback is demonstrated using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and implemented in Apache Spark via PySpark.

## 3. Statistical Inference

**[3.1 A/B Testing in Cookie Cats](https://github.com/earth1987/ab-testing-cookie-cats)**

An A/B test is used to evaluate level design for the Cookie Cats video game.

## 4. Data Visualization

**[4.1 Learning App KPIs](https://public.tableau.com/views/LearningappKPIs/GameKPIs?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)**

An interactive dashboard displaying key performance metrics for a gamified learning app. Themes include in-game stats, performance, engagement, and finance metrics.
