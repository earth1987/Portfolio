## Projects

**[AB testing cookie cats](https://github.com/earth1987/ab-testing-cookie-cats)**

An AB test is used to evaluate level design for the Cookie Cats video game.

**[Generating Data Visualisations from
Natural Language Statements](https://github.com/earth1987/Generating-Data-Visualisations-from-Natural-Language-Statements)**

The creation of charts and dashboards requires data manipulation and visualisation expertise. This inhibits many usersâ€™ ability to create bespoke content and perform new analyses. The goal of this project was to develop a pre-trained transformer-based autoregressive language model capable of generating data visualisations from natural language statements. The models tested include GPT-Neo-125M, GPT-Neo-1.3B, GPT-Neo-2.7B and GPT-J-6B.

**[Time series analysis](https://github.com/earth1987/time-series-stock-prices)**

An ARIMA time series model is trained to predict stock prices for Nintendo.

**[Clustering segmentation](https://github.com/earth1987/retail-customer-segmentation)**

The goal of this project was to conduct customer segmentation using a clustering algorithm. This involved dividing a diverse customer base into smaller, homogeneous groups based on shared characteristics such as demographics, behavior, or preferences. The clustering algorithms tested include k-means, k-prototypes and hierarchical clustering.

**[Learning app KPIs](https://public.tableau.com/views/LearningappKPIs/GameKPIs?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)**

An interactive dashboard displaying key performance metrics was developed for a gamiefied learning app. Themes include in-game stats, performance, engagement and finance metrics.
