# Projects

## Machine learning

**[Recommendation systems](https://github.com/earth1987/book-content-based-recommender)**
The goal of this project was to develop a book recommendation system. Three content-based recommendation systems were created and benchmarked against each other. These systems were implemented using TF-IDF, word2vec, and Sentence-BERT, matching users to books based on their reading history.

**[Customer segmentation](https://github.com/earth1987/retail-customer-segmentation)**
  
Clustering algorithms are used to segment a diverse customer base into smaller, homogeneous groups based on shared characteristics. The algorithms tested include k-means, k-prototypes and hierarchical clustering.

**[Generating data visualisations from natural language statements](https://github.com/earth1987/Generating-Data-Visualisations-from-Natural-Language-Statements)**
  
A pre-trained transformer-based autoregressive language model capable of generating data visualisations from natural language statements is developed. The models tested include GPT-Neo-125M, GPT-Neo-1.3B, GPT-Neo-2.7B and GPT-J-6B.

**[Price prediction using linear & non-linear regression](https://github.com/earth1987/house-price-regression)**
  
Regression models are used to predict house prices. Both linear models (ordinary least squares, ridge & LASSO Regression) and non-linear models (k-nearest neighbors, random forest & XGBoost) are tested.

**[Stock price time series analysis](https://github.com/earth1987/time-series-stock-prices)**
  
An ARIMA time series model is trained to predict stock prices for Nintendo.

## Machine learning in the cloud

**[Movie recommendation system](https://github.com/earth1987/movie-recommender-als)**

A movie recommendation system is developed using alternating least squares and implemented in Apache Spark via PySpark. Google Cloud Dataproc is used to deploy a Spark cluster during model training.

**[Topic modelling for survey feedback](https://github.com/earth1987/feedback-topic-modelling)**

Topic modelling on text feedback is demonstrated using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and implemented in Apache Spark via PySpark.

## Statistical inference

**[AB testing cookie cats](https://github.com/earth1987/ab-testing-cookie-cats)**

An AB test is used to evaluate level design for the Cookie Cats video game.

## Data visualisation

**[Learning app KPIs](https://public.tableau.com/views/LearningappKPIs/GameKPIs?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)**

An interactive dashboard displaying key performance metrics for a gamiefied learning app. Themes include in-game stats, performance, engagement and finance metrics.
