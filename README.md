# Projects

## 1. Supervised Machine Learning

**[1.1 Predictive & Econometric Modelling for Annual Savings](https://github.com/earth1987/predicting-annual-savings)**

Annual net savings are predicted at customer level using Ridge Regression & Random Forests. Additionally, ordinary least squares is used to develop an econometric model to explain how explanatory variables each savings.

**[1.2 Early Detection of Breast Cancer](https://github.com/earth1987/predict-breast-cancer)**

Breast cancer diagnoses are predicted using cell nuclei characteristics extracted from images of breast tissue. The predictive model developed couples Principal Component Analysis with Logistic Regression.

**[1.3 Anticipating Machine Failure](https://github.com/earth1987/machine-failure)**

Predicting machine failure is framed as a imbalanced binary classification problem. The following types of model are optimised and compared: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and XGBoost. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is also tested.

**[1.4 Classifying Type of Machine Failure](https://github.com/earth1987/machine-failure-type)**

The task of predicting machine failure is reframed as a multiclass classification problem. The objective was to classify machines into different failure categories. The predictive model developed couples SMOTE with a Random Forest.

**[1.5 Forecasting Property Values](https://github.com/earth1987/house-price-regression)**

Regression models are used to predict house prices. Both linear models (ordinary least squares, ridge & LASSO Regression) and non-linear models (k-nearest neighbors, random forest & XGBoost) are tested.

**[1.6 Predicting Nintendo Stock Prices](https://github.com/earth1987/time-series-stock-prices)**

An ARIMA time series model is trained to forecast stock prices for Nintendo.

## 2. Unsupervised Machine Learning

**[2.1 Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/earth1987/retail-customer-segmentation)**

Clustering algorithms are used to segment a diverse customer base into smaller, homogeneous groups based on shared characteristics. The algorithms tested include k-means, k-prototypes, and hierarchical clustering.

<br>

## 3. Recommendation Systems

**[3.1 Book Recommendation Systems](https://github.com/earth1987/book-content-based-recommender)**

Three content-based book recommendation systems were created and benchmarked against each other. These systems were implemented using TF-IDF, word2vec, and Sentence-BERT, matching users to books based on their reading history.

**[3.2 Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/earth1987/movie-recommender-als)**

A collaborative filtering based movie recommendation system is developed using alternating least squares and implemented in Apache Spark via PySpark. Google Cloud Dataproc is used to deploy a Spark cluster during model training.

## 4. Natural Language Processing

**[4.1 Generating Data Visualizations from Natural Language Statements](https://github.com/earth1987/Generating-Data-Visualisations-from-Natural-Language-Statements)**

A pre-trained transformer-based autoregressive language model capable of generating data visualizations from natural language statements is developed. The models tested include GPT-Neo-125M, GPT-Neo-1.3B, GPT-Neo-2.7B, and GPT-J-6B.

**[4.2 Topic Modelling for Survey Feedback](https://github.com/earth1987/feedback-topic-modelling)**

Topic modelling on text feedback is demonstrated using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and implemented in Apache Spark via PySpark.

<br>

## 5. Statistical Inference

**[5.1 A/B Testing in Cookie Cats](https://github.com/earth1987/ab-testing-cookie-cats)**

An A/B test is used to evaluate level design for the Cookie Cats video game.

<br>

## 6. Data Visualization

**[6.1 Learning App KPIs](https://public.tableau.com/views/LearningappKPIs/GameKPIs?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)**

Annteractive dashboard displaying key performance metrics for a gamified learning app. Themes include in-game stats, performance, engagement, and finance metrics.
